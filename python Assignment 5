3. What is the most significant distinction between a dictionary and a list?
The most significant distinction is that:
•	A list is an ordered collection of elements indexed by positions (integers).
•	A dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs, where each key must be unique and immutable, and values are accessed via keys.

4. What happens if you try to access spam['foo'] if spam is {'bar': 100}?
If spam is {'bar': 100} and you try to access spam['foo'], a KeyError will be raised because the key 'foo' does not exist in the dictionary.

5. If a dictionary is stored in spam, what is the difference between the expressions 'cat' in spam and 'cat' in spam.keys()?
